## Reporting a Vulnerability

If my code has a security issue which is critical and needs to be fixed asap, please [check whether the issue has already been reported or not here](https://github.com/Leayal/PSO2-Launcher-CSharp/issues).
If it hasn't been reported, [you can report a new issue here](https://github.com/Leayal/PSO2-Launcher-CSharp/issues/new/choose). When reporting, please assign the `security` label to the issue.

### Note: Please understand that this project is just a hobby one. Therefore, I can't maintain it 24/7. However, I will read the reports if I have time and when I do, I will give a reply about `when` (and perhaps `how` as well) I fix the issue if I'm able to.
